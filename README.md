### The story of the game

Dale Conti, a college student, was on his way to become a paramedic.\
But, he fell for heroin. His life became a mess. Months ago, he robbed a bank.\
His criminal partner killed a cop, and ran away, but Dale got caught.

Now, he is in a prison.\
Because of what he did, a cop is dead. His consciousness wouldn't allow him to rest.\
Deep down, he is a good man, but he made too many mistakes.

During the trial, he chose to admit his crime, even though he could defend himself,\
which, at least, can save a few years in prison.\
But he chose to be here, to be punished for what he did.\
At least, that's what he thought.

The reality is that Wally Nightingale, the cop who's in charge of Dale's case,\
is desperate to find out Dale’s criminal partner, the killer of the cop.\
Wally’s obsession with catching murderers turns him into an unscrupulous policeman.\
Even in prison, he continued to torture Dale, just to make Dale confess his accomplices.\
Dale was firm, he chose to go to prison for the purpose of punishing himself.\
Once, Wally realized this. He was so mad.\
He started insulting Dale repeatedly, denying Dale’s redemption.\
But, eventually, he found another way, slander.\
He elaborately spread the rumor, which Dale is a snitcher.

Now, everyone in the prison thinks Dale is a dog (a snitcher).\
That's the worst kind in here.\
Everyone want him to be dead. Especially, Barnes. He is planning to kill Dale.
