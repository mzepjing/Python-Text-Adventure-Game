# Shantaram Text Game


### Description of the project

I am proud to have designed a text-based adventure game that utilizes various Python essentials. To create this game, I incorporated my knowledge of strings and string manipulation, user-defined functions and objects, user input and input handling, conditional and nested conditional statements, loops, and controlling for errors. By utilizing these concepts, I was able to design a game that is both engaging and challenging for players. The game involves making decisions and navigating through different scenarios, which requires the player to use critical thinking skills. Through this project, I was able to apply my understanding of Python programming and problem-solving skills, further developing my proficiency in this language. Overall, creating a text-based adventure game allowed me to showcase my creativity and knowledge of Python programming.
